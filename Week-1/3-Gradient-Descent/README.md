Gradient Descent from Scratch 📉A Python implementation of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm for Linear Regression, built entirely from scratch without using high-level ML libraries for the core logic.This project demonstrates the mathematical "engine" behind how machine learning models learn, by iteratively minimizing a cost function to find the line of best fit.🧠 The MathematicsThe goal is to find the optimal values for slope ($m$) and intercept ($b$) that minimize the error between predicted and actual values.1. The Hypothesis (Prediction)We approximate the relationship between variables $x$ and $y$ using a linear equation:$$y_{pred} = m x + b$$2. The Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)To measure how "wrong" the line is, we calculate the average squared difference between actual ($y$) and predicted ($y_{pred}$) values:$$J(m, b) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + b))^2$$3. The Gradients (Partial Derivatives)To minimize the cost, we calculate the slope of the cost function with respect to $m$ and $b$. This tells us which direction to step to reach the bottom of the "valley."Derivative with respect to $m$:$$\frac{\partial J}{\partial m} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (y_i - y_{pred})$$Derivative with respect to $b$:$$\frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = -\frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y_{pred})$$4. The Update Rule (Learning)We update the weights iteratively by taking small steps ($\alpha$ or learning rate) in the opposite direction of the gradient:$$m_{new} = m_{curr} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial m}$$$$b_{new} = b_{curr} - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}$$🚀 Optimization FeaturesDynamic Convergence (math.isclose)Instead of running for a fixed number of iterations, this implementation includes an intelligent "Braking System."It tracks the Cost at every step.It uses math.isclose(current_cost, previous_cost, rel_tol=1e-20) to detect when the model has stopped improving.Result: The algorithm automatically stops early when it finds the optimal solution, saving computational resources.📊 Results: Custom Engine vs. Scikit-LearnI benchmarked my custom implementation against the industry-standard sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.MetricMy Gradient DescentScikit-Learn (Reference)DifferenceSlope ($m$)1.0177381.017736~0.000002Intercept ($b$)1.9150821.915219~0.000137Iterations415,532 (Auto-Stop)N/ASaved ~60% computeVerdict: The custom algorithm achieved identical accuracy to the library standard while demonstrating efficient convergence.🛠️ Tech StackPython 3.10+NumPy: For vectorization and array operations.Pandas: For data handling.Math: For convergence logic.Scikit-Learn: Used only for benchmarking and verification.💻 How to RunClone the repository.Install dependencies:Bashpip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
